# bizarre-story-RPG-game
A personal project between me and some friends to create a standard basic RPG game based on other 2d style RPG games, using Unity to create the game. while also applying some concepts from object oriented programming and design patterns. while animation and spirte work was being created by my friends while I handle coding the project for the project. I am planning to use factory design pattern and decorators to create all the entities from players, npc, enemies and bosses.
while using observers patterns for certain enemy behaviors. 

# future tasks
I would also like to adopt an entity, component, and system architecure for designing the game. I would also like to use some concepts of artifical intelligence or machine learning so the enemy will have varied behviors and will not be scripted. 

This project is WIP and will be updated regularly and will most likely have many changes as we move forward with the project.
